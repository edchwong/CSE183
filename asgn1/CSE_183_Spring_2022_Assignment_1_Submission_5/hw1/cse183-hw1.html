          A lion has been seen roaming the empty science library on campus. The police, noticing the intrusion,
          approached the lion and asked what was his business there. The lion replied that he was attempting to learn
          web development, and that he found the programming portions rather interesting, but the task of laying out web
          page most frustrating.

            <i>"It is truly disappointing! Great minds, such as Don Knuth and Leslie Lamport, devoted their time to
              improving the art of typography and the science of optimizing the presentation of content on a page, and
              then here come like a band of savages these web developers, oblivious to the great work of the past, with
              this completely inane and baroque language!".</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            He continued, <i>"First they invented a lot of tags. Then they fell out of love for them, and decided it's
              cooler to do things using the same few tags all over the place, decorating them with yet another language
              called CSS (the name at least it reminds me of my feeling towards it, for I know latin). So now you need
              two languages to get one thing accomplished! And the whole thing is so complex that to lay down something
              with a few columns on a page, you practically need a university degree! And look! It cannot even balance
              the content on these two colums, for goodness sake!" </i>
            The police thought it better to leave the lion alone, as he looked quite ready to bite anyone who came
            close.

        Professor de Alfaro Claims Break-Through in Graphics
      </h1>
      <div class="block">
        A new, very efficient algorithm enables fast scene rendering
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        Ray-tracing is a technique for scene rendering in which the light rays that fall into an observer's eyes are
        retraced, so to say, in the reverse direction, to reconstruct exactly what the view would have been. This is a
        daunting process, because when encoutering solid bodies, light is scattered, and so the ray tracing must chase
        the many possible backwards paths of such scattering. Professor de Alfaro recently claimed to have invented a
        new, far more efficient algorithm, one that works in microseconds regardless of the dimension or complexity of
        the scene. <i>"There are a few restrictions,"</i> he added, <i>"and for the moment our new technique is
          applicable only to closed environments in which the integral of the luminous flux is zero across any closed
          surface."</i> The contribution is currently undergoing peer review.
